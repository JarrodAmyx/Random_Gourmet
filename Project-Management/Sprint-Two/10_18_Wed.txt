Chelsea
1. I inserted our tables into mongodb and merged my search bar changes into main
2. I want to move the search bar into the static box above the ingredients sidebar but I have to figure out where that is.
3. Digging around angular

Jarrod:
1. I worked on setting up our Laravel backend on a server.
2. Today I setup the connection between our database and our backend.
3. No blockers.

Joakim:

2. Worked more on parent-child routing, seems to be working fine now.
3. No blockers
