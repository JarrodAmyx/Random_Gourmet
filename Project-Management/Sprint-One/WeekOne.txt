Joakim:
1. Upload Front-End files I've worked on separately over the summer.
   Discuss next steps with everyone to coordinate what we're all working on.
2. Start working on Login Logic and Authentication.
3. I need a user database to fully develop the authentication.

Chelsea:
1. Yesterday I reviewed our Jira Backlog for tasks and past commits to refresh myself on what we last accomplished.
2. Today I recloned my repo for a clean install from errors in our application.java but I still got red. 
I started testing a new Spring directory with folders for each class which cleared up some errors from application.java. Today
I'm mainly working on getting my development environment up to date so I can begin my Jira task on up to date + working branches. 
3. No big blockers so far unless I get merge conflicts when committing the new Spring directory. I had issues with local changes appearing
on all my new branches so had to run some git reset/clean cmds to fix issues.

Chelsea:
1. Local changes weren't being tracked by Git and I ended up disabling a bunch of extensions which also removed the red from the 
application.java.
2. Today I'm going to restructure the directory and see if Git will track those changes. I might test a registration page for the frontend
or end up researching MongoDb db server implementations for testing.
3. Blocker is Git acting up/not tracking local changes in my vscode ide.
Note: Issue for commits in .txt file was that it was set to read-only permission
ttest commits
