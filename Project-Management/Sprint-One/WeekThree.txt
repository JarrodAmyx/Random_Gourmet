Chelsea: 
1. Yesterday I worked on the mongodb instance and getting it working with the AWS instance. 
2. I went over the mongodb instance and went over using the CLI w mongo and AWS for inserting the user tables.
Today I will work on the registration frontend page w CSS. 
3. Blocker is mongdb CLI cmds in AWS and finding a way to see the db w a UI. I'll be seeing is I can use MongoDB compass.
