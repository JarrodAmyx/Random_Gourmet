Chelsea: 
1. Yesterday I worked on the mongodb instance and getting it working with the AWS instance. 
2. I went over the mongodb instance and went over using the CLI w mongo and AWS for inserting the user tables.
Today I will work on the registration frontend page w CSS. 
3. Blocker is mongdb CLI cmds in AWS and finding a way to see the db w a UI. I'll be seeing is I can use MongoDB compass.

Joakim:
1. Didn't work on this yesterday.
2. Keep working on the Login and Registration Logic.
3. Same as previous weeks, user database.

Jarrod:
1. Yesterday I researched different APIs and create a list of code we need to get from the API.
2. Today I am implementing API into our java code by creating a model to get information.
3. What's blocking me is asynchttp not working with our framework.

Wednesday 9/13/2023

Jarrod:
1. Yesterday I started implementing the API for the Java code by creating a model for it.
2. Today I am going to fix issues with getting the asynchttp packages working in the controller. Once this is done, I can test the code properly.
3. I'm being blocked by inconsitent information on how to solve this issue.


Ryan:
1. Yesterday I worked on css and tried to clean the stylesheets to make it more consistent for the future
2. I'm researching on implementing login authentication and tokens

Brian:
1. Yesterday I was attempting to fix the odd syntax issues with Java and Spring Boot.
2. Today I worked with others in the group in order to finially fix all the odd issues for everyone.
3. I'm being blocked by  some family issues which are occurring within my life.

Joakim:
1. Didn't work on this yesterday.
2. Debugging Java files, and developing user related classes/methods
3. Same as previous weeks, user database.

Chelsea:

1. Yesterday I consulted Ryan on what he was doing for the front end login page since it should match up w the registration page.
we already had popups going for both of those so I looked into better UIUX practices to improve it. (ex Mobbin)
2. Today I was waiting for Ryan to push the code so I could fix the registration form to match.
3. Blocker is coordinating tasks that are directly correlated to similar tasks. Earlier in the week I went over how to access our 
mongodb instance on aws and Jared showed me how to use the aws CLI. I have the json schemas for our db tables so I'll have to go
back into the CLi and get those in but im not sure if there is a UI to see what is acutally being inserted/validated. I 
need to see if I can use Mongodb Compass but not sure.

Friday 9/15/2023

Chelsea:
1. Yesterday I didn't work on the sprint.
2. Today I want to get RGV-23 and RGV 32 done so I can move on to RGV-37 & 38. I have RGV-22 which is testing the db with recipes
which will be contingent on how the recipe api works. I'll have to see the format of the recipes being pulled in.
3. Blockers is going to be inserting json data into mongodb AWS CLI and not being able to visually validate it. 

Jarrod:
1. Yesterday I fixed a lot of the issues with Asynhttp but there is still an issue.
2. Today I'm going to fix the async issues. The problem the other day was it was showing errors because packages didn't exist. Now that the packages exist they still show an error.
3. What's blocking my progress is the lack of feedback the system is giving to me.
