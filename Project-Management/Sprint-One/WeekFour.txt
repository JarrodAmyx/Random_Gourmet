Chelsea:
1. Yesterday I pushed a lot of code for the sidebar ingredients frontend. I established relationships between major 
food categories and its subcategories. 
2. Today I'm focusing on refining how it looks + making it match up w the figma. 
3. There are a couple things I need to consider such as creating an option that adds new ingredients that are pulled
from a recipe but not in the pantry. The sizing of the buttons is being fickle too and I'm working on fixing the style
of the buttons to our original version.
