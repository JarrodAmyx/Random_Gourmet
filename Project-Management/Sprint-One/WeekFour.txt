Chelsea:
1. Yesterday I pushed a lot of code for the sidebar ingredients frontend. I established relationships between major 
food categories and its subcategories. 
2. Today I'm focusing on refining how it looks + making it match up w the figma. 
3. There are a couple things I need to consider such as creating an option that adds new ingredients that are pulled
from a recipe but not in the pantry. The sizing of the buttons is being fickle too and I'm working on fixing the style
of the buttons to our original version.

Brin:
1. Yesterday I had focused my efforts on a seperate project for another class.
2. Today I focused on checking all files related to the User and services to prepare for connecting front and backends.
3. There's a lot of files to parse through as well as potential overlap between each person's progress in already implementing the connection.

Ryan
1. Yesterday I wrote code for the user profile. It contains user information and a favorite ingredients list that will eventually be accessed from the database.
2. Today, I'm working on a search bar to filter saved recipes.
3. Todo: search bar, deleting items from list

Chelsea:
1. Yesterday I finished up the front end for the ingredients sidebar. I'd like to do mmore refinement and focus on UX for it later. 
2. Today I pushed additional image assets for the rest of our UI and new code for the updated sidebar component UI. I also uploaded json to make
the user db in AWS mongo so we have that going now. 
3. No blockers.
