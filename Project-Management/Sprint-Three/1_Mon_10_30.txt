Jarrod:

Joakim:
1. List what is left to do, add new tasks to Jira & adjust points, and get rid of obsolete functions related to routing.
2. Add more tasks if necessary and make sure all tasks are distributed so we're on the same page.

   If I have time I'll also get to work on the secure/public toolbar differences.
3. Need login to be fully functional to finish the project UI flow and experiment with secure/public routes.
