Joakim:
1. List what is left to do, add new tasks to Jira & adjust points, and get rid of obsolete functions related to routing.
2. Add more tasks if necessary and make sure all tasks are distributed so we're on the same page.
   Finish UI flow diagram.
   If I have time I'll also get to work on the secure/public toolbar differences.
